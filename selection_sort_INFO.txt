You're working with an implementation of the **Selection Sort** algorithm in Python. Let’s break it down **step-by-step**, both conceptually and through the code.

---

## 🔍 **What is Selection Sort?**

**Selection Sort** is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It divides the list into two parts:
- The **sorted** part (built from left to right)
- The **unsorted** part (shrinks as we proceed)

### 🧠 Basic Idea:
For each position in the array:
1. Find the **minimum** element in the unsorted part.
2. Swap it with the element at the current position.
3. Repeat for the next position.

---

## 🧾 **Detailed Code Explanation**

```python
def selection_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
```
- We get the length of the array.
- We'll go through the array from index `0` to `n - 1`.

---

### 🔁 Outer Loop

```python
for i in range(n):
```
- `i` is the current index where we want to place the smallest unsorted element.

---

### 🔍 Find the Smallest Element in Remaining Array

```python
min_idx = i
for j in range(i+1, n):
    if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]:
        min_idx = j
```

- Start by assuming the element at `i` is the smallest (`min_idx = i`).
- Loop through the rest of the array (`i+1` to `n-1`) and update `min_idx` whenever you find a smaller element.

---

### 🔁 Swap

```python
arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]
```

- Once the smallest element is found, **swap** it with the current index `i`.

---

### 🔁 Repeat

The loop continues to build up the **sorted portion on the left**, moving through the array one element at a time.

---

### 📥 Taking Input from the User

```python
arr = list(map(int, input("Enter the numbers for selection sort: ").split()))
```

- Accepts space-separated numbers from the user.
- Converts them to a list of integers using `map(int, ...)`.

---

### 🖨️ Output

```python
print("Original array:", arr)
print("Sorted array:", selection_sort(arr))
```

## 🔄 Example Walkthrough

Input:  
```
Enter the numbers for selection sort: 5 4 6 3 2 8
```

### Step-by-step:

- Initial: `[5, 4, 6, 3, 2, 8]`
- Iteration 1 (`i = 0`): Find min in `[5, 4, 6, 3, 2, 8]` → 2 → Swap with 5 → `[2, 4, 6, 3, 5, 8]`
- Iteration 2 (`i = 1`): Min in `[4, 6, 3, 5, 8]` → 3 → Swap with 4 → `[2, 3, 6, 4, 5, 8]`
- Iteration 3 (`i = 2`): Min in `[6, 4, 5, 8]` → 4 → Swap → `[2, 3, 4, 6, 5, 8]`
- Iteration 4 (`i = 3`): Min in `[6, 5, 8]` → 5 → Swap → `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]`
- Iteration 5 (`i = 4`): Min in `[6, 8]` → 6 → No swap needed
- Final: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]`

## 📊 Time & Space Complexity

| Case       | Time Complexity |
|------------|-----------------|
| Best Case  | O(n²)           |
| Worst Case | O(n²)           |
| Average    | O(n²)           |

- Because it **always compares every unsorted element**, regardless of order.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) — it’s **in-place**, using no extra storage.

## ✅ Summary

- **Simple and easy to understand**
- **Not very efficient** for large datasets
- Good for **learning purposes** or when memory is constrained
