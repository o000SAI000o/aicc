Here's a comprehensive **case study on Amazon EC2** along with detailed information about **creating an EC2 instance** and understanding the **concept behind Amazon EC2 web services**.

## üìò **Case Study: Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**

### ‚úÖ **What is Amazon EC2?**

Amazon EC2 is a part of Amazon Web Services (AWS) that provides **scalable computing capacity in the cloud**. It allows users to launch **virtual servers** (called instances), configure security, and manage storage for running applications on-demand, without needing to invest in physical hardware.

---

## üß† **Concept Behind Amazon EC2**

### 1. **Elasticity**
EC2 enables you to scale capacity up or down automatically based on your application‚Äôs needs (Elastic Load Balancer + Auto Scaling Group).

### 2. **On-demand Virtual Machines**
You can launch any number of virtual servers, use them as long as needed, and shut them down when done ‚Äî **pay-as-you-go**.

### 3. **Instance Types**
EC2 offers different instance types optimized for compute, memory, storage, or GPU needs (e.g., `t2.micro`, `m5.large`, `c6g.xlarge`).

### 4. **Security**
You can configure **key pairs**, **security groups**, **IAM roles**, and **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** for secure access and isolation.

### 5. **Integration with Other AWS Services**
EC2 integrates seamlessly with Amazon RDS, S3, CloudWatch, IAM, EBS, and more.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Steps to Create an EC2 Instance (AWS Free Tier)**

### üìù **Pre-requisites:**
- AWS account
- Free tier eligible

---

### üîß **Step-by-Step Guide to Launch EC2**

#### 1. **Login to AWS Console**
Go to [https://aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com) and log in.

---

#### 2. **Go to EC2 Dashboard**
Search for **"EC2"** in the services search bar and click **"EC2"**.

---

#### 3. **Launch an Instance**
Click on **"Launch instance"**.

---

#### 4. **Configure Instance Details**

| Option | Recommended Setting |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Name** | `MyFirstEC2` |
| **AMI** | Amazon Linux 2023 (or Ubuntu 22.04 if you prefer) |
| **Instance Type** | `t2.micro` (Free Tier eligible) |
| **Key Pair** | Create a new key pair (save `.pem` file) |
| **Network Settings** | Allow SSH (port 22), HTTP (port 80), HTTPS (port 443) |
| **Storage** | Default 8 GB is fine for testing |

---

#### 5. **Review and Launch**
Click **Launch Instance** ‚Üí View instances

---

#### 6. **Connect to Instance**
- Select your instance ‚Üí Click "Connect" ‚Üí Choose **SSH client**
- Use the terminal with your downloaded `.pem` file:
```bash
chmod 400 mykey.pem
ssh -i "mykey.pem" ec2-user@<public-ip-address>
```

## üí° Use Case: Hosting a Simple Website

Once connected via SSH:

```bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install httpd -y
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
echo "Welcome to My EC2 Instance Web Page" | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html
```

Visit your **public IPv4 address** in a browser to see your web page.

## üìä Real-World Usage of EC2

| Company | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| Netflix | Video streaming backend infrastructure |
| NASA | Satellite image processing |
| Airbnb | Hosting web applications |
| Slack | Scalable chat architecture |

- **Security Groups vs. NACLs**
- **Elastic IP vs. Public IP**
- **AMI Customization**
- **Load Balancers + Auto Scaling Groups**
- **Spot Instances vs. Reserved vs. On-Demand**
