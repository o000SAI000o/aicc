Certainly! Let's go deeper into both the **conceptual understanding** and the **code execution** of the **N-Queens problem**, especially as implemented in your program.

---

## 🧠 What Is the N-Queens Problem?

- You have an **N×N chessboard**.
- You must place **N queens**, such that **no two queens attack each other**.
- In chess, a **queen** can move:
  - Vertically (↑↓)
  - Horizontally (←→)
  - Diagonally (↖↘ and ↗↙)
- So you must **ensure no two queens share**:
  - The same row
  - The same column
  - The same diagonal

## 🧮 Problem-Solving Strategy: **Backtracking**

**Backtracking** is a general algorithmic technique that builds the solution **step by step**, and **undoes** choices that lead to failure.

### Applied to N-Queens:
1. Place a queen in a row.
2. Move to the next row.
3. If a valid position is found, continue.
4. If no valid position is found, **backtrack**: remove the last queen and try a new position.

---

## 🔍 Let’s Break the Code Down Further

---

### 1️⃣ `is_safe(board, row, col, n)`

This function is used to **check if it's safe** to place a queen at position `(row, col)`.

```python
def is_safe(board, row, col, n):
```

We need to ensure that **no other queen** threatens this position.

---

#### ✅ Check 1: Column Conflict (↑)

```python
for i in range(row):
    if board[i][col] == 1:
        return False
```

- We only need to check rows **above the current row** because we place queens **top-down** (one row at a time).
- If there's a queen in the same column `col` in any previous row `i`, then `(row, col)` is **unsafe**.

---

#### ✅ Check 2: Left Diagonal Conflict (↖)

```python
i, j = row, col
while i >= 0 and j >= 0:
    if board[i][j] == 1:
        return False
    i -= 1
    j -= 1
```

- This checks the **upper-left diagonal** from `(row, col)` toward the top-left corner.
- If any cell on this diagonal has a queen, it's unsafe.

---

#### ✅ Check 3: Right Diagonal Conflict (↗)

```python
i, j = row, col
while i >= 0 and j < n:
    if board[i][j] == 1:
        return False
    i -= 1
    j += 1
```

- This checks the **upper-right diagonal** from `(row, col)` toward the top-right corner.
- Again, if any queen is found, the current position is unsafe.

---

#### ✅ Safe!

If none of the above checks return `False`, the function returns `True`, indicating that `(row, col)` is **safe**.

---

### 2️⃣ `solve_n_queens(board, row, n)`

This function is the heart of the **recursive backtracking** algorithm.

```python
def solve_n_queens(board, row, n):
```

We are trying to place queens **one row at a time**.

---

#### Base Case:

```python
if row == n:
    print_solution(board, n)
    return
```

- If `row == n`, we have placed N queens successfully.
- So we **print the solution** and **return**.

---

#### Loop Through All Columns in This Row:

```python
for col in range(n):
    if is_safe(board, row, col, n):
        board[row][col] = 1  # Place queen
        solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n)  # Recurse
        board[row][col] = 0  # Backtrack
```

- We **try each column** in the current row.
- If it's **safe**, we:
  1. **Place the queen** at `(row, col)`
  2. **Recurse** to the next row (`row + 1`)
  3. After returning, **remove the queen** (backtrack) and try the next column

This way, we explore **all possible board configurations** and print every valid solution.

---

### 3️⃣ `print_solution(board, n)`

This simply prints the board.

```python
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        print('Q' if board[i][j] == 1 else '.', end=" ")
    print()
```

- `Q` represents a queen.
- `.` represents an empty square.
- This helps you **visualize** the solution.

---

### 4️⃣ Main Driver

```python
n = 4
board = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
print(f"Solutions for {n}-Queens Problem:")
solve_n_queens(board, 0, n)
```

- Initializes an empty `n x n` board filled with 0s.
- Starts solving from row `0`.

---

## 🔄 Example of Backtracking in Action (n = 4)

Let’s simulate the steps for 4×4:

1. Try placing a queen at (0,0)
2. Move to row 1
   - Try (1,0) → not safe (same column)
   - Try (1,1) → not safe (diagonal)
   - Try (1,2) → safe
3. Place at (1,2), move to row 2
   - Try (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) → all unsafe
   - Try (2,3) → safe
4. Place at (2,3), move to row 3
   - Try all → no safe position
5. **Backtrack** from (2,3), try new positions
6. Eventually find full solution or explore all

---

## 🧠 Time Complexity

The time complexity is **O(N!)**, because:
- Each queen can be placed in N positions, but with constraints, so it’s **less than N** at each level.

---

## ✅ Summary

- The code **systematically places queens** row by row.
- It uses **backtracking** to explore all possible board configurations.
- It **avoids placing queens** in columns or diagonals under attack.
- It **prints all valid solutions**.
