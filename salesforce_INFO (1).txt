To install and configure **Google App Engine (GAE)** on **Ubuntu**, you typically work with the **Google Cloud SDK (gcloud)**, which includes the tools needed to deploy applications to App Engine.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to install and configure GAE on Ubuntu:

---

### ðŸ”§ Step 1: Install Required Dependencies
```bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl apt-transport-https ca-certificates gnupg -y

- curl*: Needed to fetch files from the web.
- *apt-transport-https*: Allows APT to use repositories over HTTPS.
- *ca-certificates*: Ensures SSL certificates are recognized as trusted.
- *gnupg*: Used to handle GPG keys for secure software installation.

```


### â˜ï¸ Step 2: Add the Google Cloud SDK Repository
```bash

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg] http://packages.cloud.google.com/apt cloud-sdk main" | \
sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-cloud-sdk.list

curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | \
sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg
```

---

### ðŸ”„ Step 3: Install Google Cloud SDK
```bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt install google-cloud-sdk -y
```
- Installs the CLI tool (gcloud) for interacting with Google Cloud services.
- Includes utilities to manage projects, App Engine, Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, etc.
---

### âœ… Step 4: Initialize Google Cloud SDK
```bash

gcloud init


```
- This command will open a browser to log into your Google account.
- Select the project you want to use or create a new one.
- Set the default configuration.

---

### ðŸš€ Step 5: Install App Engine Component
```bash
gcloud components install app-engine-java  # For Java
gcloud components install app-engine-python  # For Python
gcloud components install app-engine-go  # For Go
gcloud components install app-engine-php  # For PHP
```

Install only the one you need, or all of them.

---

### ðŸŒ Step 6: Create and Set Up App Engine for Your Project
```bash
gcloud app create
```
- Choose a region for your app.

---

### ðŸ“¦ Step 7: Deploy Your Application
Make sure your project has an `app.yaml` file, then run:
```bash
gcloud app deploy
```

---

### ðŸ” Step 8: View Your App Online
```bash
gcloud app browse
```
